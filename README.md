# FindItFaster

[![CI pipeline - release](https://github.com/jellydn/vscode-finditfaster/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=release)](https://github.com/jellydn/vscode-finditfaster/actions?query=branch%3Amain)
![Platform support](<https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macos%20%7C%20linux%20%7C%20windows%20(wsl)%20%7C%20windows%20powershell%20(experimental)-334488>)

Finds files and text within files, but faster than VS Code normally does.

Make sure to check the [Requirements](#requirements) below (TL;DR: have `fzf`, `rg`, `bat` and `node` on your
`PATH`).

## Default Key Bindings

- `cmd+shift+j` / `ctrl+shift+j`: Search files
- `cmd+shift+u` / `ctrl+shift+u`: Search for text within files
- `cmd+shift+ctrl+u` / `ctrl+shift+alt+u`: Search for text within files with type pre-filtering
- `cmd+shift+alt+f` / `ctrl+shift+alt+f`: Pick a file from git status
- `cmd+shift+alt+t` / `ctrl+shift+alt+t`: Find TODO/FIXME comments

You can change these using VS Code's keyboard shortcuts.

## Recommended Settings

```json
{
  // Setup FindItFaster extension
  "find-it-faster.customTasks": [
    // Choose folder to open on new window
    {
      "name": "zoxide",
      "command": "cursor $(zoxide query --interactive)"
    }
  ],
  // Allow top open a file with line number
  "find-it-faster.general.openCommand": "code -g"
}
```

## Features

This plugin is useful for:

- Very large projects with lots of files (which makes VS Code's search functionality quite slow)
- Users who love using `fzf` and `rg` and would like to bring those tools inside VS Code

The extension provides five main commands:

1. Search for files and open them
2. Search within files for text and open them
3. Search within files with file type pre-filtering
4. Pick file from git status
5. Find TODO/FIXME comments

## Live Grep

The Live Grep feature now supports selecting multiple files. Users can use the following keys in fzf:

- Tab: Select/deselect a file
- Shift+Tab: Deselect all files
- Enter: Confirm selection(s)

Multiple selected files will be opened in separate tabs or windows, depending on your VS Code configuration.

- [ ] TODO: Add new demo per setting

## Requirements

Ensure you can run `fzf`, `rg`, `bat`, and `sed` directly in your terminal. If those work, this plugin will work as expected.

- [`fzf` ("command-line fuzzy finder")](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [`rg` ("ripgrep")](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [`bat` ("a cat clone with wings")](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.dev) LTS
